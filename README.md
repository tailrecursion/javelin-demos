# Javelin Demos

[Javelin](https://github.com/tailrecursion/javelin) is a
spreadsheet-like Functional Reactive Programming (FRP) library for
ClojureScript.

This project contains a variety of programs that demonstrate the use
of Javelin to create reactive web applications.

You can see some version of the demos running at [Javelin
Demos](https://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/u/12379861/javelin_demos/index.html).

## Building Locally

You can build the demos yourself with `lein cljsbuild once` and
