[Javelin](https://github.com/tailrecursion/javelin) is a
spreadsheet-like Functional Reactive Programming (FRP) library for
ClojureScript.

This project contains a variety of programs that demonstrate the use
of Javelin to create reactive web applications.

You can see some version of the demos running at [Javelin
Demos](http://tailrecursion.com/~alan/javelin-demos/).

## Building Locally
